- TURN and STUN servers minimize peer-to-peer network latency by traversing multiple layers of NATs 
- signaling methods and protocols are not specified by WebRTC; it is outlined instead by JSEP; 
- should future versions of WebRTC use JSON instead of SDP?
- ICE, STUN, and TURN are necessary to establish and maintain a peer-to-peer connection over UDP.

** OFFER/ANSWER mechanism **
- p1 create RTCPeerConnection object
- p1 create offer and set local description with offer details
- p1 stringify the offer and use signaling mechanism to send offer to p2
- p2 calls setRemoteDescription with offer 
- p2 creates answer; p2 sets answers as local description; p2 sends stringified answer back to p1
- p1 sets answer using setRemoteDescription
